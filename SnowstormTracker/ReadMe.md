Predicting snowstorms in the Washington D.C area is a complete nightmare for forecasters.
Studying different computer models that display storm tracks differing by 20-40 miles
makes it challenging to pinpoint what exactly will happen in each locality. Sometimes Central Md
can see half a foot of snow while D.C sees wet streets and frustrated workers who didn't get
the day off they were hoping for. There are a multitude of factors that determine if a storm is
likely in this area. They range from the basic surface level weather observations such as temperature,
dewpoint temperature, and ground temperature to more complex atmospheric conditions such as the Ocean Patterns,
where atmospheric blocking sets up, and how the jet stream is configured. I intend to create an application that predicts
weather a snowstorm is likely based on a series of parameters including some of the things I have already mentioned and
many more that I find are a significant factor through research.
